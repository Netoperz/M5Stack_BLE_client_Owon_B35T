# ESP32 M5Stack BLE client for OWON B35T meter

You can remotely read and control Owon B35T meter

P.S. current changes in arduino-esp32 git (after 04.03.2018) cause increase final sketch size over the permissible size (https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/issues/1194),<br>
one of the possibilities is increasing app partition size as wrote in this excellent blog:<br>

I publish this sketch as it is.
I do not have free time to clean it up and polish.
